It would be best if you cloned the code repository.

* Firstly, you need to install the Git software, then use the commands below:
* Git command to clone `git clone [repository_URL]`, where  [repository_URL] is the copied URL from the green button with name code.
  * If you are not familiar with git commands, download the code repository as a zip file and extract it.
* Now, open your terminal screen and change the current directory to the downloaded folder.
* Use command `javac [File_Name].java` to create the bytecode file.
* Finally, run the java code using command  `java [File_Name]`.

> Note: the file name must be the same as the class that is implemented inside the file. Or you will get a message.

`Error: Could not find or load main class`
